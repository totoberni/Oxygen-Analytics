You are absolutely right to focus on this—it is the most critical step in preparing your data for a machine learning model. Mixing time-series data of different frequencies is a classic problem in financial modeling.

Here is a breakdown of the optimal strategy to handle your daily, weekly, and quarterly data for your XGBoost predictor.

### The Core Problem

You have features at different time granularities:
- **Daily:** Stock prices, trading volume.
- **Weekly/Monthly:** Macroeconomic indicators.
- **Quarterly:** Earnings data and your aggregated NLP sentiment scores.

Your goal is to predict daily stock price changes, so you need a feature set where every feature has a value for every single trading day.

### The Wrong Approach: Down-sampling to Quarterly

Your first instinct is correct: simply aggregating all data to a quarterly level is a bad idea.
- **Why it's bad:** You would lose over 98% of your most valuable data (the daily price movements and technical indicators). Your model would only be able to make one prediction every three months, making it useless for any practical trading strategy.

### The Optimal Strategy: Aligning to a Daily Frequency with Forward-Filling

The standard and most effective industry practice is to align all features to the highest relevant frequency, which in your case is **daily**.

This means each row in your final dataset will represent **one trading day**.

Here’s how you handle each data type:

**1. Daily Data (e.g., Stock Prices):**
This forms the base of your DataFrame. Each day has its `close_price`, `daily_return`, `volume`, etc.

**2. Lower-Frequency Data (e.g., Quarterly NLP Sentiment):**
You do not try to guess or interpolate the values for the days in between. Instead, you **forward-fill** the data. This means a value, once released, is considered the "current truth" for every day forward, until a new value is released.

Let's visualize this with your `News_Sentiment_Mean` which is calculated quarterly:

| Date       | Daily_Return | Quarterly_News_Sentiment |
|------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| 2024-01-01 | 0.5%         | -0.04  (Value from 2023-Q4 is carried forward) |
| ...        | ...          | -0.04                    |
| 2024-01-30 | -0.2%        | -0.04                    |
| 2024-01-31 | 1.2%         | 0.12   (New value for 2024-Q1 is released)     |
| 2024-02-01 | 0.3%         | 0.12   (2024-Q1 value is now carried forward)  |
| ...        | ...          | 0.12                     |
| 2024-04-29 | 0.8%         | 0.12                     |
| 2024-04-30 | -0.5%        | 0.09   (New value for 2024-Q2 is released)     |

**Why this works so well for XGBoost:**
- **No Information Loss:** You keep all your daily data.
- **Represents Reality:** This mimics how markets work. The Q4 sentiment score *is* the most recent public information available every day during Q1, until the new Q1 data is published.
- **Tree-Based Model Advantage:** XGBoost is excellent at finding rules based on these static states. It can learn patterns like, "When the `Quarterly_News_Sentiment` has been `> 0.1` for the last 30 days AND a daily technical indicator crosses a threshold, then X is likely to happen."

### Advanced Heuristic: "Time Since Event" Features

To give your model even more power, you can engineer features that measure the "staleness" of your low-frequency data.

**1. "Days Since Update" Feature:**
- Create a new column, e.g., `days_since_sentiment_update`.
- This column would be `0` on the day a new quarterly sentiment score is released (e.g., Jan 31).
- It would be `1` on the next day (Feb 1), `2` on the day after, and so on.
- It would reset to `0` when the next quarter's data is released (e.g., Apr 30).
- **Benefit:** The model can learn that information is most potent when it's fresh and its predictive power might decay over time.

**2. "Is Event Day" Feature:**
- Create a binary (0 or 1) column, e.g., `is_earnings_day`.
- This would be `1` ONLY on the day a 10-K or 10-Q filing is released, and `0` on all other days.
- **Benefit:** This explicitly flags market-moving event days, allowing the model to learn that price behavior might be fundamentally different on those specific days.

### Your Go-Forward Plan:

1.  **Target Frequency:** Set **daily** as the target frequency for your final training DataFrame.
2.  **Aggregate Low-Frequency Data:** Proceed with your plan to calculate the quarterly NLP sentiment scores. Do the same for your other low-frequency data (e.g., monthly macro indicators).
3.  **Merge Intelligently:** Use a tool like `pandas.merge_asof` to combine your different datasets. This function is specifically designed to merge time-series data of different frequencies by performing a forward-fill join, which is exactly what we need.
4.  **Feature Engineering:** Create the advanced "time since event" and "is event day" features to add more temporal context for your model.
